                                A reckless driving charge on your record can be very costly and result in 
                                not just financial losses but also other penalties.

                                The law defines reckless driving as the following:

                                A highway is any publicly maintained area that is “open to the public for purposes of

                                On the other hand, an off-street parking facility is “a parking area open for use by

                                It includes both privately and publicly owned facilities. However, the facility must be 
                                open to the general public, otherwise “it is not covered by this statute.”

                                Privately owned mall parking spaces, for example, are included but privately owned

                                Under California law, a driver is said to be acting with a wanton disregard for safety when:
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify abt-p-txt">

                                ignore that risk.

                                It is the prosecutor’s responsibility to meet the burden of proof. The prosecutor 
                                has to gather evidence to show that the defendant was actually behind the wheel on 
                                an off-street parking facility or highway.
                            </p>

                                In addition to this, the prosecutor must also prove that it wasn’t a mistake on the 
                                defendant’s part and he or she intentionally drove recklessly.
                            </p>

                                The word “intentionally” has to be paid special attention to. It helps distinguish between 
                                reckless driving and other kinds of dangerous driving behaviors.
                            </p>

                                Compare someone with a reckless driving charge to an individual with narcolepsy, a chronic 
                                sleep disorder to understand the difference the term ‘intentional’ makes.
                            </p>

                                The former deliberately paid no attention to the laws or the safety of others on the 
                                road; whereas, the latter did not make the mistake deliberately. While both might get 
                                charged, the charges will be different.

                                The distinction is of huge importance, especially when combined with some more serious offenses.
